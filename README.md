# World Bank funding trends over the past 3 years
This is a project that I did in a bootcamp wherein I was tasked to deliver a well-structured presentation that highlights the key trends in World Bank funding over the past three years.
## Objective
Imagine that you have been asked to provide an overview of the World Bankâ€™s funding trends. Your job is to prepare graphs/visuals that show World Bank funding trends over the past 3 years. The narrative should address the following points:
* What are the most significant funding trends?
* Which countries and sectors received the highest allocations, and why might this be significant?
* Are there any notable patterns, shifts, or outliers that warrant attention?
## Method
* Data was provided and compiled in https://iatistandard.org using the "World Bank" filter
* Python was used to streamline data preparation by removing unnecessary columns, merging tables, splitting comma-separated values in cells, and aggregating data for analysis.
* Power BI was used to create clear visuals showing funding trends for each country. DAX formulas were also used to add new columns, making the analysis easier to understand.
## Results
